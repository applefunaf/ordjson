    "procedure_details": "Palladium(II) acetate (65.3 mg, 0.29 mmol) and 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (336 mg, 0.58 mmol) were mixed together in a reaction vessel and evacuated and purged with nitrogen 3 times. Toluene (35 ml) was added and the resulting mixture was heated to to 50°C for 45 minutes.  To this mixture was added 3-bromo-2-methyl-5-nitropyridine (694 mg, 3.20 mmol), then 4-(pyridin-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine (500 mg, 2.91 mmol) and cesium carbonate (1421 mg, 4.36 mmol), and  the resulting mixture heated at 90 °C for 16 hours.  The reaction mixture was cooled to RT, 50ml EtOAc was added and the mixture was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated, diluted with EtOAc (200 mL), and washed sequentially with water (150 mL) and saturated brine (150 mL). The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated to afford crude product, ~2g brown wet solid.  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 4% MeOH in DCM. Pure fractions eluting at 3% were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(2-methyl-5-nitropyridin-3-yl)-4-(pyridin-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine (169 mg, 18.86 %) as a colourless solid.  .  "
