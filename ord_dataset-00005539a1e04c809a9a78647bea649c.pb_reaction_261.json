The filtrate was concentrated and purified by flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with 0 to 3% methanol in dichloromethane. The solvent was evaporated to dryness to afford 6-chloro-N-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)pyrazin-2-amine (1.95 g,34.4% uv purity 94.6%) as a white solid.   Nevertheless the 2 batches were combined to afford 6-chloro-N-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)pyrazin-2-amine (5.10 g, 90 %)  "
