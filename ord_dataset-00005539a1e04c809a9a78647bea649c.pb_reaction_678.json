(Note: Based on the observation in EN07946-41, _DMF was added to improve the heating due to the low thremal absorbance of toluene.)_  One hour later, LCMS showed 13% of the precursor MH+257/259 @ 0.84 min and 36% of the desired mass MH+291 @ 0.86 min along with some unknowns on a 2-min basic run.  The reaction seemed not complete. The reaction was microwaved at 115 °C for another 45 min.  One hour and 45 min later, LCMS showed 7% of the precursor MH+257/259 @ 0.84 min and 37% of the desired mass MH+291 @ 0.86 min along with some unknowns on a 2-min basic run. The reaction seemed stuck, and was cooled to RT.  **_September 29 2015_**  The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc, washed with water, filtered, and evaporated to give a brown solid as the crude product. The crude product was added to a Biotage column, and was eluted with 15-100%EtOAc in Heptane. Collected fractions.  **_September 30 2015_**  Based on TLC and LCMS, the product fractions were combined, and evpoarated to give an yellow-brown solid, which was vacuumed overnight at 40 °C  **_OCtober 1 2015_**  Based on LCMS, it was 100% pure; based on NMR, it was 90~95% pure, and contained 0.1eq of DMF.
