The catalyst was filtered off and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The remaining oil was subjected to CC (n-heptane/ethyl acetate--15:1) to give 4,4-di-(2-tolyl)-1-butanol (17 g). A solution of 4,4-di-(2-tolyl)-1-butanol (19 g) in acetic acid (400 mL) was boiled under reflux for 3 hrs. The cooled solution was evaporated in vacuo to give 4,4-di-(2-tolyl)-1-butyl acetate (17 g) as an oil. A solution of 4,4-di-(2-tolyl)-1-butyl acetate (9.2 g) in 57% aqueous iodic acid (150 mL) was boiled under reflux for 3 hrs. The cooled solution was poured into a mixture of ice and water and the aqueous phase was extracted with diethyl ether. The combined organic phases were washed with water and a saturated aqueous solution of NaCl, dried (Na2SO4) and evaporated in vacuo to give the title compound 34a (11.7 g) as an oil, which was used without further purification. 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ1.80-2.10 (m,4H), 2.28 (s,6H), 3.17 (t,2H), 4.26 (t,1H), 7.12 (s,8H)"
