Then, 0.048 g of tin octanoate as a catalyst was added, and the contents were held at 130째 C. for 20 hours while introducing nitrogen gas therein, thereby polymerizing the monomers. After completion of the polymerization, a bulk polymer taken out of the cylinder was ground into fine particles having a particle size of about 3 mm or smaller, and the fine particles were dried overnight at about 50째 C. under reduced pressure of about 0.1 kPa to remove remaining monomers, thereby obtaining a glycolic acid/lactic acid copolymer [Polymer (P-C3)]. The same process was conducted repeatedly to prepare a necessary amount of Polymer (P-C3). The polymer thus obtained had a glass transition temperature, Tg of about 44째 C. and was a noncrystalline amorphous substance."
