    "procedure_details": "N6 -Benzoyl-9-(2'-fluoro-b-D-ribofuranosyl)adenine was prepared from 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine in a five-step synthesis using a modification of a procedure reported by Ikehara at al. [Nucleosides and Nucleotides, 2, 373-385 (1983)]. The N6 -benzoyl derivative was obtained in good yield utilizing the method of transient protection with chlorotrimethylsilane. Jones [J. Am. Chem. Soc., 104, 1316 (1982)]. Selective protection of the 3' and 5'-hydroxyl groups of N6 -Benzoyl-9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine with tetrahydropyranyl (THP) was accomplished by modification of the literature procedure according to Butke et al. [Nucleic Acid Chemistry, Part 3, p.149, L. B. Townsend and R. S. Tipson, Eds., J. Wiley and Sons, New York, 1986], to yield N6 -Benzoyl-9-[3',5'-di-O-tetrahydropyran-2-yl)-β-D-arabinofuranosyl]adenine in good yield. Treatment of N6 -Benzoyl-9-[3',5'-di-O-tetrahydropyran-2-yl)-β-D-arabinofuranosyl]adenine with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride in dichloromethane gave the 2'-triflate derivative N6 -Benzoyl-9-[2'-O-trifluoromethylsulfonyl-3',5'-di-O-tetrahydropyran-2-yl)-β-D-arabinofuranosyl]adenine which was not isolated due to its lability. Displacement of the 2'-triflate group was effected by reaction with tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran to obtain a moderate yield of the 2'-fluoro derivative N6 -Benzoyl-9-[2'-fluoro-3',5'-di-O-tetrahydropyran-2-yl)-β-D-arabinofuranosyl]adenine. Deprotection of the THP groups of N6 -Benzoyl-9-[2'-fluoro-3',5'-di-O-tetrahydropyran-2-yl)-β-D-arabinofuranosyl]adenine was accomplished by treatment with Dowex-50W in methanol to yield N6 -benzoyl-9-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-β-D-ribofuranosyl)adenine in moderate yield. The 1H-NMR spectrum was in agreement with the literature values. [Ikehara and Miki, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 26, 2449 (1978)]. Standard methodologies were employed to obtain the 5'-dimethoxytrityl-3'-phosphoramidite intermediates N6 -Benzoyl-9-[2'-fluoro-5'-O-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-β-D-ribofuranosyl]adenine and N6 -Benzoyl-[2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-5'-O-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)]adenosine-3'-O-(N,N-diisopropyl-β-cyanoethylphosphoramidite.
