Argon was let to bubble in the mixture for 5 minutes. The reaction was heated to 90 °C, over a period of 90 minutes. LCMS showed complete and pretty clean reaction. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature under stirring, diluted with dichloromethane and decalite speed + was added. The mixture was concentrated and the crude product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with 0 to 5% methanol in ethyl acetate/DCM (1/1). The solvent was evaporated to dryness, a bit of diethyl ether was added in order to crystallised but it didn't work. So it was concentrated again to afford 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-N-methylbenzamide (50.0 mg, 94 %) as a brown dry film.  "
