LCMS didn't show a complete clean reaction (as Cs2CO3 got stuck on the flask). Vigourous stirring was applied and theaction was heated to 90 °C, over a period of 90 minutes under nitrogen. Crude LCMS was as expected. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature under stirring, diluted with dichloromethane and decalite speed + was added. The mixture was concentrated and the crude product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with 0 to 5% methanol in ethyl acetate/DCM (1/1). The solvent was evaporated to dryness, giving a gummy foam of P1 (490mg). A bit of diethyl ether then a lot of pentane were added to obtain a solid, which was dried under vacuum at 50°C to afford 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-N-methylbenzamide (450 mg, 77 %) as an yellow solid.
