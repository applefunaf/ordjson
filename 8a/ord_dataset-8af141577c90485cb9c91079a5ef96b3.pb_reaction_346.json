The mixture was cooled and was diluted and stirred. The mixture was vacuum filtered and the product was rinsed and dried to obtain 1.257 g of triphenyl carbinol. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and the residue was taken up in water. Crystallization occured and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes and was vacuum filtered. The solid was rinsed and dried to obtain 1.68 g of raw product. The latter was dissolved in 4 ml of a molar solution of sodium bicarbonate and the insolubles were ground up. The mixture was vacuum filtered and the filtrate was rinsed with water. 0.24 ml of acetic acid were added to the filtrate and the mixture was vacuum filtered. The precipitate was rinsed with water and dried to obtain 426 mg of purified product. 0.15 ml of formic acid were added to the filtrate and crystallization occured. The mixture was vacuum filtered and the product was rinsed with water and dried to obtain 505 mg of more pure anti isomer of 3-acetylthiomethyl-7-[{2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl) -2-methoxyiminoacetyl}amino]-ceph-3-eme-4-carboxylic acid melting at 190° C."
