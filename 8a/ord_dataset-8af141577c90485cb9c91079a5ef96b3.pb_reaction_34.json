The acid solution was heated to 90° C. and then, under vigorous stirring, 105 g of 1,1-di-n-propyl-n-butylisocyanate, prepared as previously described, were slowly added. The operation of addition lasted one hour after which the reaction medium was heated for a further 4 hours at a temperature between about 95° and 100° C. The mixture was then cooled to about 0° C. and the colourless crystals so obtained were filtered off dried by exposure to the air and then in a dessicator in the presence of potassium hydroxide. In this manner, 99 g of 1,1-di-n-propyl-n-butylamine hydrochloride were isolated in the form of a white crystalline powder."
