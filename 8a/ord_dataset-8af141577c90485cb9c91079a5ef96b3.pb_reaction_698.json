The residue was stirred with 400 ml of water, the water was decanted, and the residue was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran. The solution was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated. The residue was mixed with 50 g of silica gel and purified by dry column chromatography, a 9/1 v/v chloroform/tetrahydrofuran mixture being used as eluent. The band containing product was extracted with tetrahydrofuran, the solvent was evaporated from the extract under reduced pressure and the residue was dried in a vacuum oven. The residue was stirred with ether and the solid was collected and dried to give methyl 2,3-dihydro-5-(4-(1-hydroxyethyl)phenyl)-2-benzofurancarboxylate (6D), mp: 98°-100° C."
