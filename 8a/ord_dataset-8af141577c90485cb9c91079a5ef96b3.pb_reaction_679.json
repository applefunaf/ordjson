The solution was filtered through charcoal, chilled and the solid product was separated. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was held in a freezer over a weekend. 20 ml of water was added with stirring and the solid was collected. The solid was stirred with a further 20 ml of water; the solid was collected, washed with ether, and triturated with hexane until a gum precipitated. The solvent phase was separated. The gum was again triturated with hexane and the solvent phase was separated. The two extracts were combined; the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue was washed with ether, then dried to 4, as a solid, mp: 138°-140° C."
