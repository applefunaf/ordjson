During this time starting material dissolved and then a white crystalline solid began to form and eventually the reaction mixture almost solidified. The reaction was cooled to ~5째 and then was diluted with 100 ml EtOH. The solids were filtered off and were washed in EtOH and ether to give 1-[2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)ethyl]-4-phenylpiperazine as its monohydrochloride. The salt was dissolved in 150 ml hot MeOH and 50 ml H2O and was then treated with 25 ml triethylamine. Water was then added to the refluxing mixture just to the cloud point whereupon the product began to crystallize from solution. The mixture was chilled and the solids were collected by filtration to give the end product, mp 142째-143째."
