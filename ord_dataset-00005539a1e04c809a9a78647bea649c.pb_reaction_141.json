The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to rt, the insolubles were removed by filtration, washed with EtOAc and the filtrate was concentrated. (Insolubles~25g, which seemed to contain very little P1 by TLC and LCMS).  The crude product (24.5g) was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with 0 to 5% methanol in ethyl acetate (pure AcOEt to remove by- product coming from overreaction). The solvent was evaporated to dryness to afford a foam (12.5g) which was dissolved in dichloromethane (100ml). The resulting crystalline precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with dichloromethane. The filtrate was concentrated down, taken up into DCM and a second crop was collected by filtration, which was combined with the first batch and dried to a constant weight to afford 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-6-methoxy- N-methylbenzamide (11.51 g, 75.0 %) as a white crystalline solid.  The filtrate was concentrated to dryness, taken up into DCM and collected by filtration to give a second sample EN02972-35-02 (0.41 g, 0.944 mmol, 2.67 %).  "
