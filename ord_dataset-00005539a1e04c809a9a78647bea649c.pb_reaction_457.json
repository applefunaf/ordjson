The vial was capped and flushed with nitrogen. Dioxane (2.5 mL) was added and the vial was flushed with additional nitrogen before it was irradiated in a microwave reactor at 120 Â°C for 1.5 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with dichloromethane and filtered through a pad of diatomaceous earth. The pad was rinced repeatedly with dichloromethane, then the solvents were removed _in vacuo_. Handed over to the preparative chromatography group for purification (see attached report). The desired fractions were pooled and concentrated _in vacuo_. The residue was partitioned between water and dichloromethane (x1), the organic layer was passed through a phase separator and concentrated _in vacuo_. The residue was redissolved in acetonitrile and water was added. Freeze-dried over weekend to give 4-(8-(4-fluorophenyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-ylamino)-N,N-dimethylbenzamide (67.5 mg, 40.9 %).  "
