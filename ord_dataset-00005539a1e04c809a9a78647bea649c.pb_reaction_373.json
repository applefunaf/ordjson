The mixture was allowed to cool. DCM (5 mL) was added and the mixture was filtered through a short pad of Celite. The filtrate was collected and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The crude product was added to a silica gel column and was eluted with 0-5% MeOH in DCM. The collected fractions were combined and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was submitted for separation by chiral SFC to yield 5-(2-methoxy-6-(4-methyl-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyrido[3,2-f][1,4]oxazepin-8-ylamino)pyridin-3-yl)-1-methylpyridin-2(1H)-one (0.055 g, 26.8 %) and 5-(2-methoxy-6-(4-methyl-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyrido[3,2-f][1,4]oxazepin-8-ylamino)pyridin-3-yl)-1-methylpyridin-2(1H)-one (0.051 g, 24.80 %).
