The total volume of the reaction mixture was deoxygenized carefully by switching vacuum-argon 10-times and heated to 110 °C under argon.  After 10 min the mixture turned into green. The reaction was monitored by HPLC, after 22 h only ca 65 %. The reactuion was stopped and the mixture was cooled to room temperature. Toluene was removed in vacuo. The residual was dissolved in dichloromethane ( 1.2 L) and extracted with water (2*1 L). The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc(600 mL). The combined orange organic phases were filtered through a celitepad and concetrated in vacuo. Dark orange brown sticky gum was obtained which solidified over 2 weeks.  This solid was slurried in EtOAc (60 mL) at reflux point for 1 h, then it was cooled to rt slowly with vigorous stirring. Filtration afforded a light yellow solid and an orange filtrate.  0.5 g of the filtercake was purified by preparative HPLC, it afforded 303 mg light yellow solid which was submitted to PARD directly (EN01460-38-001).  1.8 g of the filtercake was purified by preparative HPLC, it afforded 1.02 g light yellow solid and 1.015 g was submitted to PARD directly in a standard bascoded bottle (EN01460-38-002) (barcode: 30152995).  The residual material was used for recrystallization studies in the RSL group.  "
