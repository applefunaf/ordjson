The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to rt, the insolubles were removed by filtration, washed with EtOAc and the filtrate was concentrated. (Insolubles~23g).  The crude product (20g) was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with 0 to 5% methanol in ethyl acetate. The solvent was evaporated to dryness to afford a foam (7.9g) which was taken up into dichloromethane (40ml) (no time to get dissolved, it crashed out very quickly) and sonicated for 5 minutes. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with dichloromethane and dried under vacuum at 50Â°C to a constant weight to afford 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-5-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-6-methoxy- N-methylbenzamide (6.53 g, 46.0 %) as a white solid.  The filtrate was concentrated to dryness (residue weight: 700mg), taken up into DCM and collected by filtration to give a second sample EN02972-51-02 (0.36 g, 0.829 mmol, 2.53 %).  "
