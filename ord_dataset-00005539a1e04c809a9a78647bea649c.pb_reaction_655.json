LCMS indicated the completion of reaction. The solvent was removed by concentration, taken into 2ml of DMSO, filtered, the filtrate was purified with reverse phase chromatography column (eluted with 5% to 50% 0.1%TFA in ACN/0.1%TFA in water) and repurified with basic condition (eluted with 5% to 95% ACN/10MM ammonium acetate and 10MM ACN in water), still not pure enough for submission.  Repurified again by analytical group, to yield (S)-2-(4-(6-(3,4-dimethylpiperazin-1-yl)-4-methylpyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-8-(hydroxymethyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (64.0 mg, 26.5 %) as a light yellow solid.
