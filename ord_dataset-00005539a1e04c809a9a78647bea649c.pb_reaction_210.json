Reaction was degassed with nitrogen. The reaction was stirred at 90 °C for 12 hours => _incomplete (~85% conversion)_. A few Pd(OAc)2, Xantphos and Cs2CO3 were added. Reaction was degassed with nitrogen and stirred at 90°C for 2 hours => _almost complete._ The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, diluted with dichloromethane and MeOH and silica (40-63 µm) was added. Mixture was concentrated to dryness. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with 0 to 12% methanol in ethyl acetate. Solvent was evaporated to afford product as a yellow foam. This was triturated in Et2O and petroleum ether and the resulting precipitate was sonicated for 10 minutes. Solid was filtered and dried under high vacuum to afford 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-5-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-N-(2-hydroxyethoxy)benzamide (86 mg, 48.6 %) as a yellow solid.
