It was due to the low thremal absorbance of toluene. Therefore, DMF was added to improve this situation.)_  LCMS showed no precursors and 87% of the desired mass MH+291 @ 0.87 min on a 2-min basic run. The reaction was cooled to RT.  **_September 25 2015_**  The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc, washed with water, filtered, and evaporated to give a brown solid as the crude product.  The crude product was added to a silica gel column, and was eluted with 20-100%EtOAc in Heptane. Collected fractions. Based on TLC and LCMS, most product fractions contained a non-MS-ionization unknown, were combined, and evpoarated to give an orange-yellow solid.  The orange-yellow solid was reloaded to a silica gel column and was eluted with 20-100%EtOAc in Heptane . Collected fractions .  **_September 28 2015_**  Based on TLC and LCMS, the product fractions were combined, and evpoarated to give a pale-yellow solid.  Based on LCMS, it was 93% pure; based on NMR, it was 94~95% pure.  "
