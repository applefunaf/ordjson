Then 5-fluoro-4-(2-methyl-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)-1H-imidazol-5-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine (0.998 g, 3.6 mmol), 4-(4-bromobenzyl)morpholine (0.968 g, 3.78 mmol), Sodium tert-pentoxide (0.634 g, 5.76 mmol) and toluene (20 mL) were added. The reaction mixture became sticky yellowish green maybe by addition of the base. It was degassed carefully and stirred at 100 °C under argon.  In 1 hour the sticky mixture turned from yellowish green into orange brown muddy mixture. The reaction was followed by HPLC. After 22 h 98 % conversion was obtained. Then it was cooled to rt and filtered. The obtained dark brown crapy filtercake was discarded. The brown filtrate was diluted with dichloromethane (80 mL), extracted with water (3*100 mL), washed with brine (1*100 mL) and dried over Na2SO4. Filtration and concentration afforded orange solid (1.400 g). To this orange solid EtOAc (7 mL) was added and heat to 80 ºC. At 60 ºC it started to form light precipitation. Extra EtOAc (10 mL) was added and stirred at 80 ºC for 10 min. Then it was cooled to rt with a continuous stirring. The light precipitation was filtered off, washed with EtOAc (7 mL) and _n_ -pentane (15 mL), and dried in vacuo. Light yellow powder was obtained.  "
