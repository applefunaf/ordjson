A 20 mL microwave reactor vial was charged with 5-chloro-7-(cyclopropylamino)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-3-carbonitrile (1.2 g, 5.14 mmol), N-(5-amino-2-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)(methyl)amino)phenyl)acetamide (1.414 g, 5.65 mmol), 2-Di-t-butylphosphino-2',4',6'-tri-i-propyl-1,1'-biphenyl (0.218 g, 0.51 mmol), Pd2dba3 (0.235 g, 0.26 mmol) and CS2CO3 (5.02 g, 15.41 mmol). The vessel was fitted with a septum and gas inlet and dioxane (20 mL) was added via syringe. The resulting suspension was stirred for 5 min under nitrogen. The septum and gas inlet was quickly replaced with a microwave vial cap and the mixture was heated at 150 degrees under microwave irradiation for 1h. Two reactions combined and filtered through celite. The filtrate concentrated and submitted for purification (report attached).  **Received a 3 different set up fractions:**  First set up fractions (EN02868-04-1), LC-MS looks clean but 1H NMR shows acetate peak, couldn't getrid of it even longer time on lyohillizer.  Second setup fractions combined, lyophllized, purified by ISCO column (0 - 20% MeOH-CH2Cl2 \\+ 0.05% TEA). The obtained compound is a gum. It was triturated with 2 ml of EtOAc, formed a nice solid, it was filtered, washed with Et2O and dried to give 230 mg of white solid. 1H NMR showed slight shift of couple of peaks, it may be due to the protonation. 63 mg of this compound registered and submitted (EN02868-04-2).  Third setup fractions showed no required product peaks, was discarded.  EN02868-04-1, the remaining material after submission (EN02868-04-2), the filtrate of EN02868-04-2 combined, concentrated, treated with 3 g of MP- carbonate in THF (30 ml). After 1 h stirring, it was filtered washed with THF, concentrated, triturated with CH3CN, filtered and dried to give white color solid (EN02868-04-3).  Conclusion: Product isolated  "
